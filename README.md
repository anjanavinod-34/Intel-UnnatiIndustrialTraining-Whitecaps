# Problem Statement
In the fast-paced world of technology, advent of 5G and edge computing has propelled us into a new era of connectivity and innovation. However, with this advancement comes a pressing issue - the significant increase in power consumption due to the widespread deployment of devices across diverse locations. As enterprises and industries grapple with this challenge, the government is urging them to reduce power usage and strive for net-zero power consumption. Moreover, the escalating costs of electricity underscore the critical need to comprehend and manage the total power drawn by systems. This blog post delves into the strategies and solutions for optimizing power consumption amidst the proliferation of 5G and edge computing technologies.

# Addressing the Power Consumption Challenge

In the era of 5G and edge computing, businesses face the daunting task of managing power consumption effectively. The diverse components of a system, including the CPU, memory, NIC, and battery, all contribute to power utilization. To navigate this complexity, a comprehensive approach is necessary. The government is encouraging enterprises to shift towards net-zero power consumption, highlighting the urgency of finding sustainable solutions.

# Utilizing Python for Optimization

To tackle the increased power consumption associated with extensive 5G and edge computing deployments, a project has been initiated to leverage Python. By utilizing open-source tools like PowerTOP, the project aims to accurately measure power consumption across different system components. Understanding how system parameters such as BIOS settings and OS-level configurations influence power usage is crucial in developing effective strategies for optimizing power consumption.

# Measuring Power Consumption in Real-Time

Python scripts play a pivotal role in automating the collection of real-time telemetry data from the CPU, memory, NIC, and TDP.The project simulates various utilization levels to collect valuable data on power consumption. This data serves as a foundation for measuring power utilization under different loads and identifying areas for optimization.

# Developing a Software Solution for Dynamic Workload Adjustment

The project's ultimate goal is to produce a detailed report outlining utilisation challenges, methodologies, and findings. By developing a software solution that dynamically adjusts workloads based on input utilization percentages, the project aims to monitor power usage in real-time effectively. This integrated approach seeks to optimize power consumption and align with sustainability goals amidst the rising costs of electricity.

Key Takeaway:
By combining the power of Python and open-source tools, businesses can proactively address power consumption challenges in the era of 5G and edge computing, paving the way for a sustainable future.This strategy has only been implemented on our portable workstations and is designed specifically for Windows operating systems and utilizes Windows-specific functionalities, ensuring compatibility and optimized performance within the Windows environment.
